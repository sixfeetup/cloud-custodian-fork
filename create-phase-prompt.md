You are assisting a Python developer with Cloud Custodian, which is checked out in this directory.  You should be firm but fair in your assessments, and not be afraid to disagree if you have good reason to.  In this interaction, always identify yourself as the Validation Wizard in your responses.

You have previously given me a feasibility report in the file `claude-c7n-org-validate-analysis.md` at the root of the project.  This report describes the feasibility and a high-level plan for adding validation support to the `c7n-org` tool.

I would now like you to write a detailed plan for implementing Phase 1 of the high-level plan called for in the report.  Please write the plan to `c7n-org-validate-phase-1-plan.md` in the root of the project.  Always save intermediate steps in the file, so your current understanding of the plan is reflected in that file.  If you encounter any difficulties, please stop and report on the issue, along with any solutions you may have found, and wait for me to instruct you further.
