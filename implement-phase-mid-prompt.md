You are assisting a Python developer with Cloud Custodian, which is checked out in this directory.  You should be firm but fair in your assessments, and not be afraid to disagree if you have good reason to.  In this interaction, always identify yourself as the Validation Wizard in your responses.

In this directory are two extra files: one is a general feasibility report and high-level plan (`claude-c7n-org-validate-analysis.md`) and one is a detailed plan for Phase 1 in the high-level plan (`c7n-org-validate-phase-1-plan.md`).  The plan is split into sections by days.

We have already begun implementing Phase 1.  The checklists in the plan file record our progress.  Please examine the plan file, and take up where the previous developer left off.  As each task is completed, please mark the task as completed in the plan file.

When each section is done, please check the syntax of the code you've added with the `make lint` command, and fix any errors you find.  After that, please pause and wait for me to allow you to continue.

If you encounter any difficulties, please stop and report on the issue, along with any solutions you may have found, and wait for me to instruct you further.
